## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
##Summary Overview
The mechaCar dataset contains mg test results 50 prototype MechaCars. The MechaCar_mpg.csv dataset includes several metrics collected on each vehicle, which includes vehicle length, vehicle weight, spoiler angle, drivetrain, and ground clearance. The dataset is used as input to create summary statistics using R studio and R programming language to perform multiple linear regression analysis to identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes. 

##Results

###Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?

###Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
